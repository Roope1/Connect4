# Connect-four

An attempt to create the game [Connect-Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) in C++.

As a footnote this is my first time using c++

### How to run:

1. Compile the game using the makefile by running the command `make` in the directory
2. Run the game using `./connect.out`

### Disclaimer:

May not work on windows. I created this using Arch Linux and it works on that. For other operating systems I can not tell whether it works or not.
